**Abstract:** Recently, based the early work of Moeglin, Bakic-Hanzer have proved the Adams conjecture, which described the theta correspondence in terms of A-parameters. In this talk, we propose a refined version of Adams conjectures which also takes care of the labellings inside A-packets, and prove it in the stable range case. Our main tool is a corollary of the local intertwining relation. If time permit we will also talk about some potential applications to the metaplectic group. This is based on a joint work with Jialiang Zou.
