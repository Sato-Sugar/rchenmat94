**Abstract:** Branching law is a classical topic in representation theory which concerns certain Hom functors. It is natural to consider Ext functors associated to those Hom functors. In this talk we will report some recent progress on the study of these Ext spaces, and show a conjecture of D. Prasad, which asserts that the Ext-analogue of GGP model vanishes for tempered representations. We will also discuss some applications.
