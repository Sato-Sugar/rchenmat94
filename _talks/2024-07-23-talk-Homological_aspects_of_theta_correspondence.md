**Abstract:** Following Adams–Prasad–Savin, one can study some homological version of the theta correspondence. In this talk we show two Ext-vanishing results for the theta correspondence, and give applications to Ext-analogues of branching laws. Besides, we will exhibit some interesting examples that Ext spaces are non-zero. These are partially based on a joint work with Jialiang Zou.
