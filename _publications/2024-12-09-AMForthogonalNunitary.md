Let $$F$$ be a number field and $$G$$ an even orthogonal or unitary group over a number field. Based on the method used by Gan and Ichino (2018), we prove Arthur’s multiplicity formula for the generic part of the automorphic discrete spectrum of $$G$$ by using the theta lift. Enhancing this method, we also obtain a description of the full automorphic discrete spectrum of $$G$$ of $$F$$-rank less than or equal to one.
