The local non-tempered Gan-Gross-Prasad conjecture suggests that, for a pair of irreducible Arthur type representations of two successive general linear groups, they have a non-zero Rankin-Selberg period if and only if they are "relevant". In this paper, we prove the "period implies relevance" direction of this conjecture for general linear groups over Archimedean local fields. Our proof is based on a previous result of Gourevitch-Sayag-Karshon on the annihilator varieties of distinguished representations. Combining with a recent result of P. Boisseau on the direction "relevance implies period'', this conjecture for general linear groups over Archimedean local fields is settled.
