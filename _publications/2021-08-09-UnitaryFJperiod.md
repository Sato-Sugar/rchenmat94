The main goal of this paper is to study the unitary Friedberg-Jacquet period through their connection with the unitary Shalika period. Locally we study the multiplicity of unitary Friedberg-Jacquet periods for discrete series. Globally we prove one direction of a conjecture of Xiao-Zhang, stating that the non-vanishing of a global unitary Friedberg-Jacquet period implies the non-vanishing of the central value of the (twisted) standard L-function.
