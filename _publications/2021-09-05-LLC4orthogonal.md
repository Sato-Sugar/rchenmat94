Using theta correspondence, we obtain a classification of irreducible representations of an arbitrary even orthogonal group (i.e. the local Langlands correspondence) by deducing it from the local Langlands correspondence for symplectic groups due to Arthur. Moreover, we show that our classifications coincide with the local Langlands correspondence established by Arthur and formulated precisely by Atobe-â€“Gan for quasi-split even orthogonal groups.
