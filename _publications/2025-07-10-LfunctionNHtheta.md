excerpt: "This is a joint work with Yufeng Li, Xiaohuan Long, Chenhao Tang and Jialiang Zou, we studied the relation between the analytic property of the local L-function and Ext-theta lifting. This is an outcome of the summer school `Algebra and Number Theory 2024'."

In this paper we investigate the theta lifting of type II dual pairs over a non-Archimedean local field, by combining the homological method of Adams--Prasad--Savin and the analytic method of Fang--Sun--Xue. We have three main results: 1. we determine completely the big theta lift of an irreducible representation when its Godement--Jacquet L-function is holomorphic at a critical point; 2. we compute the big theta lift of all characters, hence determine the space of eigendistributions on matrix spaces for all characters; 3. we show that the Weil representation is projective if and only if the dual pair is almost in the stable range.
