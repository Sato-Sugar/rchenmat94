Hi! I'm an assistant professor at the [School of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.math.zju.edu.cn), Zhejiang University.
Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics](http://www.iasm.zju.edu.cn), Zhejiang University.
I obtained my Ph.D. in 2021 at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.math.nus.edu.sg) under the supervision of Prof. Wee Teck Gan.

Research interests
======
My primary research interest lies in the Langlands program and its various extensions. I'm particularly interested in the theory of theta correspondence, which is an enigmatic but powerful tool in the study of the Langlands program.
